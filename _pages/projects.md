---------|
Being part of the leading German [e-commerce](https://www.idealo.de/) online shopping platforms is all new, all fun and challenging|
I had an opportunity to work with all modern tools including java 11, MongoDB, Kafka, aws, Rancher, OpenShift, reactive programming, kotlin, spring cloud, spring data, Prometheus, Grafana, Elastic search, Kibana|
I've been exposed to a lot of e-commerce things like user tracking, A/B testing, SEO, SEM etc|
Interesting part was keeping the system 24/7 live while constantly updating the website through fully automated build pipelines|
Our current vision is to migrate to aws|
